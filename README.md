This project is a code challenge for InnoGames company.

## Assumptions

All stats ranges are between 0 and 10, that means that the following:
if endurance is 10, then the horse can run at his best speed until the distance 10 * 100 which is 1000m and after this distance the horse will start to slow down by jockey weight



## Improvements

- The code still needs more testing
- More validations for fields
- More documentations
- the interface is too simple, can be enhanced
